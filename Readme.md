Make a web app in whatever language you like. I want the API to be restful. The web app should amange a deck of cards
, so you should be able to:

- add
- delete
- return to state
of the cards.

APIS;
- Shuffle deck using 2 algorithms
    - Query params?
- In place shuffle()
- Fan (riffle) shuffle.
